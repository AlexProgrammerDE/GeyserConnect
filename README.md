GeyserMulti is an easy way for bedrock clients to connect to any Java edition servers without having to run anything.

## What is GeyserMulti?
GeyserMulti is a server that Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients can connect to that allows for a list of Minecraft: Java Edition servers to be displayed and accessed through 1 public geyser instance. It is effectively a combination of [BedrockConnect](https://github.com/Pugmatt/BedrockConnect) and [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser).
**Please note, this project is still a work in progress and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!**
